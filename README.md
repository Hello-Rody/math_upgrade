# It is a math module for python

#### If you want to do mathematical operations in python, use this one
## How to use
### factorial function
	import mathup
	result = mathup.factorial(10)
	print(result)
> Running this program...

```> 3628800⏎```
> This is the output
> This function finds the factorial of any integer
### summation function
	import mathup
	def fac(x):
		return 3 * x - 2
	result = mathup.summation(fac,1,10)
	print(result)
>Running this program...

```> 145⏎```
> This is output
> This function calculates the summation
> First, we need to define an arbitrary function
> Enter any function, an integer at the beginning of the addition, and an integer at the end of the addition as >arguments
> For example, in the above program
> Σ\[k=1~10](3x-2)
> and similar operations
